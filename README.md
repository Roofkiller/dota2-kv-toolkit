# VS Code DotA 2 KV Toolkit

This VS Code extension provides some additional features which should enhance the workflow with Valves KV-files.

## Features

At the moment there is only one feature.

* Added a `Merge KVs` command which automatically builds the `npc_units_custom.txt`, `npc_abilities_custom.txt`, `npc_heroes_custom.txt` and `npc_items_custom.txt` based on the `units`, `abilities`, `heroes`, and `items` folders located in your `scripts/npc` folder.

Warning(!) : Running this command overrides your old `npc_*_custom.txt` files.

## Known Issues
